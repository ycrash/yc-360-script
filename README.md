## What is yc-360 Script?

**yc-360 script** is a simple script that captures 16 different artifacts from your application in a [pristine manner](https://test.docs.ycrash.io/ycrash-agent/features/pristine-capture.html), which are highly useful to troubleshoot production problems. Here is the list of artifacts captured by the script:

| **Artifact**          | **What It Captures**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application Log       | Logs generated by your application—useful for identifying functional failures       |
| GC Log                | Garbage collection activity—helps detect memory overuse, frequent GCs, pauses       |
| Thread Dump           | Snapshot of all threads in the JVM—key to spotting deadlocks, BLOCKED/stuck threads |
| Heap Dump             | Memory snapshot of JVM objects—used to identify memory leaks or heavy objects       |
| Heap Substitute       | Lightweight version of heap dump when full heap dump isn’t available                |
| `top`                 | Overall CPU/memory usage of system processes                                         |
| `ps`                  | Snapshot of currently running processes                                              |
| `top -H`              | Thread-level CPU usage—helps isolate CPU-intensive threads                           |
| Disk Usage (`df -h`)  | Available/used disk space—useful when app errors stem from full disks                |
| `dmesg`               | Kernel logs—catches low-level system issues like hardware errors or OOM kills        |
| `netstat`             | Network connections, open ports, and listening sockets                               |
| `ping`                | Network latency to external or internal endpoints                                    |
| `vmstat`              | Virtual memory, I/O, and CPU scheduling stats                                        |
| `iostat`              | Disk I/O performance metrics                                                         |
| Kernel Parameters     | System tuning configurations (like swappiness, max open files)                       |
| Extended Data         | Any custom scripts or data you configure yc-360 script to collect                           |
| Metadata              | Basic system/app metadata (JVM version, hostname, uptime, etc.)                      |


## Why you need yc-360 Script?

**1. Capture Deeper 360° Artifacts for Root Cause Analysis:** Monitoring tools like APMs are excellent at reporting problems such as memory spikes, high CPU usage, or degraded response times. However, when it's time to get to the root cause, you need more than charts and alerts. For example, if memory consumption spikes, you will need a heap dump to identify which objects are leaking. If CPU usage increases, a thread dump is required to trace it back to the exact lines of code causing the spike. The yc-360 script complements your APM by collecting these deeper diagnostic artifacts in a single run—making it much easier and faster to isolate the problem.

**2. Accelerate Troubleshooting in Customer On-Prem Environments:** In many cases, our application runs on a customer’s infrastructure where you don’t have shell access or real-time visibility. Asking them to send screenshots or partial logs rarely provides enough context to troubleshoot effectively. The yc-360 script solves this by giving you a simple script that the customer can run themselves. It gathers all the essential artifacts across Application, JVM, system, and network layers - so you get everything you need to troubleshoot the issue thoroughly, even without direct access.

**3. Forecast Production Incidents During Pre-Release Testing:** Before every release, we run performance tests to validate CPU, memory, and response times. But these Macro-Metrics alone don’t reveal deeper risks. yc-360 script enables you to analyze Micro-Metrics like GC throughput, object allocation rate, socket usage, and thread pool behaviors. These overlooked Micro-metrics, signals early signs of instability, giving you a chance to identify the performance issues before they hit production.

## How to Analyze the Artifacts Generated by the yc-360-script?

You can analyze the artifacts captured by yc-360-script either manually or through [yCrash server](https://ycrash.io/). yCrash server analyzes all the captured data and generates a root cause analysis report instantly. You can use the [Bundle upload](https://docs.ycrash.io/ycrash-features/bundle-upload.html#step-1-go-to-upload-incident-form) feature in the yCrash server to analyze the captured 360-degree data.

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary><strong>1. What if I Want to Capture Additional Data that yc-360 Script Doesn’t Collect by Default?</strong></summary>
  
You can extend the functionality using the `-edScript` argument. This lets you specify a custom script that yc-360 script will execute as the final step, allowing you to capture additional logs, metrics, or custom files specific to your environment.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>2. What is the Overhead of Running yc-360 Script?</strong></summary>

The `yc-360` script is designed to be lightweight and non-intrusive, ensuring minimal impact on your application's performance. It primarily reads existing system and application data without altering configurations or consuming significant resources. In performance tests conducted on a Linux machine running a Java Spring Boot application, the script demonstrated:

- **CPU Usage:** Averaging around 0.05%, with occasional spikes up to 3% during data collection.
- **Memory Usage:** Consistently between 0.1% and 0.2%.

These metrics indicate that `yc-360` script can safely run in production environments without causing noticeable overhead. For detailed insights, refer to the [yCrash Agent Overhead Performance blog post](https://blog.ycrash.io/ycrash-agent-overhead-performance/).
